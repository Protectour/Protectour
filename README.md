# protecTour

Here at protecTour, we're making the transition between what was once considered boundaryless travel for society, and is now considered the new normal. COVID has
affected every aspect of modern-day living. Instead of restricting _all_ travel, we're using technology to broaden our horizons. Our aim, is to allow independent
tour guides share _their_ world, _with_ the world.

# User Experience (UX)

Beginner/Intermediate Team 1 of Code Institute, Dublin, developed a project which seeks to meet the criteria of the sub-theme "Thriving Together" within "Thriving is the New Normal".
A website has been created to serve tourists and independent tour guides, who have been affected by COVID19, to lift restrictions on travelling in society, through
means of tours provided In-Person and Live Video streaming.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

The Google Fonts utilised throughout this website were Lobster and Barlow, with San Serif being used as a substitute, where the selected fonts aren't supported.
Lobster Font was used against headings and Barlow Font used as paragraph and navigation text.

### Imagery

The use of imagery and photos in particular are integral to the flow of the website, as we are advertising cities worldwide, and the guides who provide tour services
within them. High quality and well styled imagery is applied throughout, with alternative descriptions applied for screen-reader compatibility.

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages in this process.

1. Sign in to your own Github account and select the GitHub repository, entitled Protectour.
2. In the main navigation bar, there is a tab with the title 'Settings', select to continue.
3. Scroll down the 'Settings' page when you see the heading 'GitHub Pages'.
4. The 'Source' subheading, will enable a dropdown where you see 'None'. Choose the 'Master Branch'.
5. The page should refresh.
6. To confirm the site has been published, scroll down to the 'GitHub Pages' heading and it should now display as 'published' highlighted with a light green background.

## Branching the GitHub Repository

1. On commencement of the project, all seven members of Beginner/Intermediate Team 1, created branches within their own version of Gitpod respository, making
sure to Git Pull the changes made by the various team members.
2. The branches were identified by the user, and the various areas of the site, which were decided, with reference to the Trello tool we used throughout.
3. To ensure that no work overlapped and the same area wasn't being worked on by multiple team members, we kept in frequent
contact using the Slack channel. This channel also served for agreement or necessary improvements.
4. The team used a link supplied by the Code Institute Slack channel to ensure Git Merges were carried out without error. [This was the link supplied.](https://buildingsoftwareproducts.com/using-git-in-a-team/)
