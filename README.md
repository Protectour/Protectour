# protecTour

Here at protecTour, we're making the transition between what was once considered boundaryless travel for society, and is now considered the new normal. COVID has
affected every aspect of modern-day living. Instead of restricting _all_ travel, we're using technology to broaden our horizons. Our aim, is to allow independent
tour guides share _their_ world, _with_ the world.

# User Experience (UX)

Beginner/Intermediate Team 1 of Code Institute, Dublin, developed a project which seeks to meet the criteria of the sub-theme "Thriving Together" within "Thriving is the New Normal".
A website has been created to serve tourists and independent tour guides, who have been affected by COVID19, to lift restrictions on travelling in society, through
means of tours provided In-Person and Live Video streaming.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

The Google Fonts utilised throughout this website were Lobster and Barlow, with San Serif being used as a substitute, where the selected fonts aren't supported.
Lobster Font was used against headings and Barlow Font used as paragraph and navigation text.

### Imagery

The use of imagery and photos in particular are integral to the flow of the website, as we are advertising cities worldwide, and the guides who provide tour services
within them. High quality and well styled imagery is applied throughout, with alternative descriptions applied for screen-reader compatibility.
